## How to Score
- ### 4-5-6 
    Highest possible roll Automatic Win
- ### Trips 
    Rolling three of the same number is known as rolling "trips". Higher trips beat lower trips, so 4-4-4 is better than 3-3-3. Any trips beats any established point.
- ### Point 
    Rolling a pair, and another number, establishes the singleton as a "point". A higher point beats a lower point, so 2-2-6 is better than 5-5-2.
- ### 1-2-3
    The lowest possible roll. If you roll 1-2-3, you automatically lose.
